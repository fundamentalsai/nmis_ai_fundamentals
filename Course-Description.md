## Course description 
The course description should adequately and accurately explain what your course is about. This information will be utilised to advertise the programme and it plays a pivotal role in convincing delegates to enrol in the course. For consistency we recommend that your description is no longer than 100 words.

Dive into the transformative power of AI in manufacturing with our course "Fundamentals of AI for Manufacturing". Designed for a broad audience, this program demystifies AI by focusing on its foundational principles and practical applications in the industrial sector. Through a blend of theoretical insights and hands-on workshops, participants will explore key modelling techniques and their impact on manufacturing processes. Ideal for managers, professionals with technical roles, and non-coders, the course offers slow-paced explanations enriched with examples, allowing attendees to experiment with AI models without delving deep into coding. Join us to unlock the potential of AI and revolutionise your manufacturing strategies.
